- 👋 Hi, I’m @MairinGoBragh
- 👀 I’m interested in FLOSS cybersec tools, amateur radio applications, and edge computing applications (particularly of the aforementioned)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cybersecurity. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on amateur radio tools, automation, disaster communications, and comm network resilience.
- 📫 How to reach me: primarily via email. 
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her/hers
- ⚡ Fun fact: I worked as a private detective for 7 years. I primarily worked as a bodyguard in executive protection, but I was known to do site protection, investigations, and overt/heavy armed (e.g. slung up with a Scorpion or an AR) protection details.
- ⚡⚡ Fun fact #2: I've been a licensed amateur radio operator since 1999, and have held the highest license since 2002. I've done emergency/disaster communications since I started in amateur radio. I'm looking toward getting commercial licensure —
- both as an individual operator (General Radiotelephone Operator's License, or GROL) and in running a local radio repeater system of my own (such as a Tier 2/Tier 3 DMR repeater system, or an NXDN repeater system — the latter is especially interesting to me).
